            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>My name is James Svacha, and I'm currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.ese.upenn.edu/" target="__blank">Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania. My research advisor is <a href="https://www.kumarrobotics.org/" target="__blank">Dr. Vijay Kumar</a>, and my focus is on state estimation and control of aerial robots, specifically quadrotors.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on novel ways of estimating quantities such as velocity and orientation by leveraging the information convayed through drag effects on quadrotors during flight. These drag effects make it possible to measure functions of the velocity and orientation using the onboard accelerometer. In addition to state estimation, I have worked on compensating for drag effects in the control loop during flight.  
            <p> When I am not working in the lab, you can find me pursuing one of many hobbies, including but not limited to photography, playing guitar, building circuits, and hacking.
