          <h2>Modeling and Compensation for First-Order Drag Effects on Quadrotors <a href="ICUAS17.pdf" style="color:grey">[Download PDF]</a></h2> 
          <p>
            This project was an attempt to 1) develop a simple lumped-parameter dynamic model for drag effects in the horizontal and vertical directions and 
            2) develop a controller to compensate for these effects. The video below shows the controller in action for the case of forward flight at a speed of 
            around 5 m/s indoors. The lagging quadrotor doesn't compensate for drag in the controller and the leading one does. Even at these moderate speeds, a 
            significant difference is seen in the position error.

          <h2>Inertial State Estimation for Quadrotors <a href="IROS18.pdf" style="color:grey">[Download PDF]</a></h2>
          <p>
            This project was an extension of the previous one. Now that such a model has been developed, we wished to use this model to estimate the 
            orientation and velocity of a quadrotor UAV using only the IMU. It turns out that the tilt component of attitude can be estimated, as well
            as the body-frame linear velocity and the yaw can be dead-reckoned, although it will drift. The tilt and the velocity are all that is needed
            to stabilize the quadrotor, and may be estimated if the yaw is unknown. In addition, our method makes it possible to estimate the thrust coefficient
            and first-order drag coefficients of the quadrotor's dynamic model. The video below shows the system in action.

          <h2>Vision-Aided Inertial State Estimation For Quadrotors <a href="RAL19.pdf" style="color:grey">[Download PDF]</a></h2>
          <p>
            We can add a camera to the robot and use feature-based methods to improve the yaw estimates. The tilt and velocity estimates from the filter can be 
            used to reject outlying feature correspondences in a computationally efficient way. In addition, this work reparameterizes the orientation of the vehicle
            so that the yaw estimate is not needed for estimating the velocity and tilt of the vehicle. The video below shows our system in action.

          <h2>Newtonian-Eulerian State Estimation For Quadrotors</h2>
          <p>
              The full system dynamics can be used to estimate additional parameters. This work is in progress and nearing completion. 
          </p>
          <h2>Wind Estimation For Quadrotors</h2>
          <p>
              By fusing vision with the filtering framework described above, the quadrotor can be used as an anemometer. This work is in progress.
